# Student Directory

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at the fictional Villains Academy :smiling_imp::mortar_board:.

This was an exercise that was part of the Makers pre-course material (Week 4).

## How to use

```
ruby directory.rb
```

#### To switch branches and view code for additional exercises
Once you have cloned the repo and are inside the working directory, you can view my code for various exercises by using the command below:

```

```
